.chapter CH:FIRST "Operating system organization"
.PP
A key requirement for an operating system is to support several activities at once.  For
example, using the system call interface described in
chapter \*[CH:UNIX]
a process can start new processes with 
.code fork .
The operating system must 
.italic-index time-share 
the resources of the computer among these processes.
For example, even if there are more processes
than there are hardware processors, the operating
system must ensure that all of the processes
make progress.  The operating system must also arrange for
.italic-index isolation 
between the processes.
That is, if one process has a bug and fails, it shouldn't affect processes that
don't depend on the failed process.
Complete isolation, however, is too strong, since it should be possible for
processes to interact; pipelines are an example.
Thus
an operating system must fulfil three requirements: multiplexing, isolation,
and interaction.
.PP
This chapter provides an overview of how operating systems are organized to achieve
these 3 requirements.  It turns out there are many ways to do so, but this text
focuses on mainstream designs centered around a 
.italic-index "monolithic kernel" , 
which is used by many Unix operating systems.  This chapter 
introduces xv6's design by
tracing the creation of the first process when xv6 starts
running.  In doing so, the text provides a glimpse of the implementation of all
major abstractions that xv6 provides, how they interact, and how the three
requirements of multiplexing, isolation, and interaction are met.  Most of xv6
avoids special-casing the first process, and instead reuses code that xv6 must
provide for standard operation.  Subsequent chapters will explore each
abstraction in more detail.
.PP
Xv6 runs on Intel 80386 or later (``x86'') processors on a PC platform, and much
of its low-level functionality (for example, its process implementation) is
x86-specific. This book assumes the reader has done a bit of machine-level
programming on some architecture, and will introduce x86-specific ideas as they
come up. Appendix \*[APP:HW] briefly outlines the PC platform.

.\"
.section "Abstracting physical resources"
.\"
.PP
The first question one might ask when encountering an operating system is why
have it at all?  That is, one could implement the system calls in
.figref unix:api
as a library, with which applications link.  In this plan,
each application could even have its own library tailored to its needs.
Applications could directly interact with hardware resources
and use those resources in the best way for the application (e.g., to achieve
high or predictable performance).  Some operating systems for
embedded devices or real-time systems are organized in this way.
.PP
The downside of this library approach is that, if there is more than one
application running, the applications must be well-behaved.
For example, each application must periodically give up the
processor so that other applications can run.
Such a 
.italic cooperative 
time-sharing scheme may be OK if all applications trust each
other and have no bugs. It's more typical for applications
to not trust each other, and to have bugs, so one often wants
stronger isolation than a cooperative scheme provides.
.PP
To achieve strong isolation it's helpful to forbid applications from
directly accessing sensitive hardware resources, and instead to abstract the
resources into services.  For example, applications interact with a file system
only through
.code open ,
.code read ,
.code write , 
and
.code close
system calls,
instead of read and writing raw disk sectors. 
This provides the application with the convenience of pathnames, and it allows
the operating system (as the implementor of the interface) to manage the disk. 
.PP
Similarly, Unix transparently switches hardware processors among processes,
saving and restoring register state as necessary,
so that applications don't have to be
aware of time sharing.  This transparency allows the operating system to share
processors even if some applications are in infinite loops.
.PP
As another example, Unix processes use 
.code exec
to build up their memory image, instead of directly interacting with physical
memory.  This allows the operating system to decide where to place a process in
memory; if memory is tight, the operating system might even store some of
a process's data on disk.
.code Exec
also provides
users with the convenience of a file system to store executable program images.  
.PP 
Many forms of interaction among Unix processes occur via file descriptors.
Not only do file descriptors abstract away many details (e.g. 
where data in a pipe or file is stored), they also are defined in a
way that simplifies interaction.
For example, if one application in a pipeline fails, the kernel
generates end-of-file for the next process in the pipeline.
.PP
As you can see, the system call interface in
.figref unix:api
is carefully designed to provide both programmer convenience and
the possibility of strong isolation.  The Unix interface
is not the only way to abstract resources, but it has proven to be a very good
one.

.\"
.section "User mode, kernel mode, and system calls"
.\"
.PP
Strong isolation requires a hard boundary between applications and the operating
system.  If the application makes a mistake, we don't want the operating system
to fail or other applications to fail. Instead, the operating system should be
able to clean up the failed application and continue running other applications.
To achieve strong isolation, the operating system must arrange that applications cannot modify (or even
read) the operating system's data structures and instructions and that
applications cannot access other process's memory.
.PP
Processors provide hardware support for strong isolation.   For
example, the x86 processor, like many other processors, has two modes in which
the processor can execute instructions: 
.italic-index "kernel mode"
and
.italic-index "user mode" .
In kernel mode the processor is allowed to execute 
.italic-index "privileged instructions" .
For example, reading and writing the disk (or any other I/O device) involves
privileged instructions.  If an application in user mode attempts to execute
a privileged instruction, then the processor doesn't execute the instruction, but switches
to kernel mode so that the software in kernel mode can clean up the application,
because it did something it shouldn't be doing. 
.figref unix:os
in Chapter  \*[CH:UNIX] illustrates this organization.  An application can
execute only user-mode instructions (e.g., adding numbers, etc.) and is said to
be running in 
.italic-index "user space"  ,
while the software in kernel mode can also execute privileged instructions and
is said to be running in
.italic-index "kernel space"  .
The software running in kernel space (or in kernel mode) is called
the
. italic-index "kernel"  .
.PP
An application that wants to read or write a file on disk must transition to the
kernel to do so, because the application itself can not execute I/O
instructions.  Processors provide a special instruction that switches the
processor from user mode to kernel mode and enters the kernel at an entry point
specified by the kernel.  (The x86
processor provides the 
.code int
instruction for this purpose.)  Once the processor has switched to kernel mode,
the kernel can then validate the arguments of the system call, decide whether
the application is allowed to perform the requested operation, and then deny it
or execute it.  It is important that the kernel sets the entry point for
transitions to kernel mode; if the application could decide the kernel entry
point, a malicious application could enter the kernel at a point where the
validation of arguments etc. is skipped.
.\"
.section "Kernel organization"
.\"
.PP
A key design question is what part of the operating
system should run in kernel mode. 
One possibility is that the entire operating system resides
in the kernel, so that the implementations of all system calls
run in kernel mode.
This organization is called a
. italic-index "monolithic kernel"  .
.PP
In this organization the entire operating system runs with full hardware
privilege. This organization is convenient because the OS designer doesn't have
to decide which part of the operating system doesn't need full hardware
privilege.  Furthermore, it easy for different parts of the operating system to
cooperate.  For example, an operating system might have a buffer cache that can
be shared both by the file system and the virtual memory system. 
.PP
A downside of the monolithic organization is that the interfaces between
different parts of the operating system are often complex (as we will see in the
rest of this text), and therefore it is easy for an operating system developer
to make a mistake.  In a monolithic kernel, a mistake is fatal, because an error
in kernel mode will often result in the kernel to fail.  If the kernel fails,
the computer stops working, and thus all applications fail too.  The computer
must reboot to start again.
.PP
To reduce the risk of mistakes in the kernel, OS designers can minimize the
amount of operating system code that runs in kernel mode, and execute the
bulk of the operating system in user mode.
This kernel organization is called a
. italic-index "microkernel"  .
.figure mkernel
.PP
.figref mkernel
illustrates this microkernel design.  In the figure, the file system runs as a
user-level process.  OS services running as processes are called servers.
To allow applications to interact with the
file server, the kernel provides an inter-process communication
mechanism to send messages from one
user-mode process to another.  For example, if an application like the shell
wants to read or write a file, it sends a message to the file server and waits
for a response. 
.PP
In a microkernel, the kernel interface consists of a few low-level
functions for starting applications, sending messages,
accessing device hardware, etc.  This organization allows the kernel to be 
relatively simple, as most of the operating system
resides in user-level servers.
.PP
Xv6 is
implemented as a monolithic kernel, following most Unix operating systems.
Thus, in xv6, the kernel interface corresponds to the operating system
interface, and the kernel implements the complete operating system.  Since 
xv6 doesn't provide many services, its kernel is smaller than some
microkernels.
.\"
.section "Process overview"
.\"
.PP
The unit of isolation in xv6 (as in other Unix operating systems) is a 
.italic-index "process" .
The process abstraction prevents one process from wrecking or spying on
another process's memory, CPU, file descriptors, etc.  It also prevents a process
from wrecking the kernel itself, so that a process can't subvert the kernel's
isolation mechanisms.
The kernel must implement the process abstraction with care because
a buggy or malicious application may trick the kernel or hardware in doing
something bad (e.g., circumventing enforced isolation).  The mechanisms used by
the kernel to implement processes include the user/kernel mode flag, address spaces,
and time-slicing of threads.
.PP
To help enforce isolation, the process abstraction provides the
illusion to a program that it has its own private machine.  A process provides
a program with what appears to be a private memory system, or
.italic-index "address space" , 
which other processes cannot read or write.
A process also provides the program with what appears to be its own
CPU to execute the program's instructions.
.PP
Xv6 uses page tables (which are implemented by hardware) to give each process
its own address space. The x86 page table
translates (or ``maps'') a
.italic-index "virtual address"
(the address that an x86 instruction manipulates) to a
.italic-index "physical address"
(an address that the processor chip sends to main memory).
.figure as
.PP
Xv6 maintains a separate page table for each process that defines that process's
address space.  As illustrated in 
.figref as ,
an address space includes the process's
.italic-index "user memory"
starting at virtual address zero. Instructions come first,
followed by global variables, then the stack,
and finally a ``heap'' area (for malloc)
that the process can expand as needed.
.PP
Each process's address space maps the kernel's instructions
and data as well as the user program's memory.
When a process invokes a system call, the system call
executes in the kernel mappings of the process's address space.
This arrangement exists so that the kernel's system call
code can directly refer to user memory.
In order to leave plenty of room for user memory,
xv6's address spaces map the kernel at high addresses,
starting at
.address 0x80100000 .
.PP
The xv6 kernel maintains many pieces of state for each process,
which it gathers into a
.code-index "struct proc"
.line proc.h:/^struct.proc/ .
A process's most important pieces of kernel state are its 
page table, its kernel stack, and its run state.
We'll use the notation
.code-index p->xxx
to refer to elements of the
.code proc
structure.
.PP
Each process has a thread of execution (or 
.italic-index thread
for short) that executes the process's instructions.
A thread can be suspended and later resumed.
To switch transparently between processes,
the kernel suspends the currently running thread and resumes another process's
thread.  Much of the state of a thread (local variables, function call return
addresses) is stored on the thread's stacks.
Each process has two stacks: a user stack and a kernel stack
.code-index p->kstack  ). (
When the process is executing user instructions, only its user stack
is in use, and its kernel stack is empty.
When the process enters the kernel (for a system call or interrupt),
the kernel code executes on the process's kernel stack; while
a process is in the kernel, its user stack still contains saved
data, but isn't actively used.
A process's thread alternates between actively using its user stack
and its kernel stack. The kernel stack is separate (and protected from
user code) so that the kernel
can execute even if a process has wrecked its user stack.
.PP
When a process makes a system call, the processor switches to the 
kernel stack, raises the hardware privilege level, and starts
executing the kernel instructions that implement the system call.
When the system call completes, the kernel returns to user space:
the hardware lowers its privilege level, switches back to the
user stack, and resumes executing user instructions just after
the system call instruction.
A process's thread
can ``block'' in the kernel to wait for I/O, and resume where it left
off when the I/O has finished.
.PP
.code-index p->state 
indicates whether the process is allocated, ready
to run, running, waiting for I/O, or exiting.
.PP
.code-index p->pgdir
holds the process's page table, in the format
that the x86 hardware expects.
xv6 causes the paging hardware to use a process's
.code p->pgdir
when executing that process.
A process's page table also serves as the record of the
addresses of the physical pages allocated to store the process's memory.
.\"
.section "Code: the first address space"
.\"
To make the xv6 organization more concrete, we'll look how the kernel creates the
first address space (for itself), how the kernel creates and starts the first
process, and how that process performs the first system call.  By tracing these
operations we see in detail how xv6 provides strong isolation for processes.
The first step in providing strong isolation is setting up the kernel to run in
its own address space.
.PP
When a PC powers on, it initializes itself and then loads a
.italic-index "boot loader"
from disk into memory and executes it.
Appendix \*[APP:BOOT] explains the details.
Xv6's boot loader loads the xv6 kernel from disk and executes it
starting at 
.code-index entry 
.line entry.S:/^entry/ .
The x86 paging hardware is not enabled when the kernel starts;
virtual addresses map directly to physical addresses.
.PP
The boot loader loads the xv6 kernel into memory at physical address
.address 0x100000 .
The reason it doesn't load the kernel at
.address 0x80100000 ,
where the kernel expects to find its instructions and data,
is that there may not be any physical memory at such
a high address on a small machine.
The reason it places the kernel at
.address 0x100000
rather than
.address 0x0
is because the address range
.address 0xa0000:0x100000
contains I/O devices.
.figure astmp
.PP
To allow the rest of the kernel to run,
.code entry
sets up a page table that maps virtual addresses starting at
.address 0x80000000
(called
.code-index KERNBASE 
.line memlayout.h:/define.KERNBASE/ )
to physical addresses starting at
.address 0x0
(see
.figref as ).
Setting up two ranges of virtual addresses that map to the same physical memory
range is a common use of page tables, and we will see more examples like this
one.
.PP
The entry page table is defined 
in main.c
.line 'main.c:/^pde_t.entrypgdir.*=/' .
We look at the details of page tables in Chapter  \*[CH:MEM],
but the short story is that entry 0 maps virtual addresses
.code 0:0x400000
to physical addresses
.code 0:0x400000 .
This mapping is required as long as
.code-index entry
is executing at low addresses, but
will eventually be removed.
.PP
Entry 512
maps virtual addresses
.code KERNBASE:KERNBASE+0x400000
to physical addresses
.address 0:0x400000 .
This entry will be used by the kernel after
.code entry
has finished; it maps the high virtual addresses at which
the kernel expects to find its instructions and data
to the low physical addresses where the boot loader loaded them.
This mapping restricts the kernel instructions and data to 4 Mbytes.
.PP
Returning to
.code entry,
it loads the physical address of
.code-index entrypgdir
into control register
.register cr3.
The value in
.register cr3
must be a physical address.
It wouldn't make sense for
.register cr3
to hold the virtual address of
.code entrypgdir ,
because the paging hardware 
doesn't know how to translate virtual addresses yet; it
doesn't have a page table yet.
The symbol
.code entrypgdir
refers to an address in high memory,
and the macro
.code-index V2P_WO
.line 'memlayout.h:/V2P_WO/' 
subtracts
.code KERNBASE
in order to find the physical address.
To enable the paging hardware, xv6 sets the flag
.code-index CR0_PG
in the control register
.register cr0.
.PP
The processor is still executing instructions at
low addresses after paging is enabled, which works
since
.code entrypgdir
maps low addresses.
If xv6 had omitted entry 0 from
.code entrypgdir,
the computer would have crashed when trying to execute
the instruction after the one that enabled paging.
.PP
Now
.code entry
needs to transfer to the kernel's C code, and run
it in high memory.
First it makes the stack pointer,
.register esp ,
point to memory to be used as a stack
.line entry.S:/movl.*stack.*esp/ .
All symbols have high addresses, including
.code stack ,
so the stack will still be valid even when the
low mappings are removed.
Finally 
.code entry
jumps to
.code-index main ,
which is also a high address.
The indirect jump is needed because the assembler would
otherwise generate a PC-relative direct jump, which would execute
the low-memory version of 
.code-index main .
.code Main
cannot return, since the there's no return PC on the stack.
Now the kernel is running in high addresses in the function
.code-index main 
.line main.c:/^main/ .
.\"
.section "Code: creating the first process"
.\"
.PP
Now we'll look at how the kernel
creates user-level processes and ensures that they are strongly isolated.
.PP
After
.code main
.line main.c:/^main/  
initializes several devices and subsystems, 
it creates the first process by calling 
.code userinit
.line proc.c:/^userinit/  .
.code Userinit 's
first action is to call
.code-index allocproc .
The job of
.code allocproc
.line proc.c:/^allocproc/
is to allocate a slot
(a
.code struct
.code proc )
in the process table and
to initialize the parts of the process's state
required for its kernel thread to execute.
.code Allocproc 
is called for each new process, while
.code userinit
is called only for the very first process.
.code Allocproc
scans the 
.code proc
table for a slot with state
.code UNUSED
.lines proc.c:/for.p.=.ptable.proc/,/goto.found/ .
When it finds an unused slot, 
.code allocproc
sets the state to
.code-index EMBRYO
to mark it as used and
gives the process a unique
.code-index pid
.lines proc.c:/p..state.=.EMBRYO/,/nextpid/ .
Next, it tries to allocate a kernel stack for the
process's kernel thread.  If the memory allocation fails, 
.code allocproc
changes the state back to
.code UNUSED
and returns zero to signal failure.
.figure newkernelstack
.PP
Now
.code allocproc
must set up the new process's kernel stack.
.code allocproc
is written so that it can be used by 
.code fork
as well
as when creating the first process.
.code allocproc
sets up the new process with a specially prepared kernel
stack and set of kernel registers that cause it to ``return'' to user
space when it first runs.
The layout of the prepared kernel stack will be as shown in 
.figref newkernelstack .
.code allocproc
does part of this work by setting up return program counter
values that will cause the new process's kernel thread to first execute in
.code-index forkret
and then in
.code-index trapret
.lines proc.c:/uint.trapret/,/uint.forkret/ .
The kernel thread will start executing
with register contents copied from
.code-index p->context .
Thus setting
.code p->context->eip
to
.code forkret
will cause the kernel thread to execute at
the start of 
.code-index forkret 
.line proc.c:/^forkret/ .
This function 
will return to whatever address is at the bottom of the stack.
The context switch code
.line swtch.S:/^swtch/
sets the stack pointer to point just beyond the end of
.code p->context .
.code allocproc
places
.code p->context
on the stack, and puts a pointer to
.code-index trapret
just above it; that is where
.code-index forkret
will return.
.code-index trapret
restores user registers
from values stored at the top of the kernel stack and jumps
into the process
.line trapasm.S:/^trapret/ .
This setup is the same for ordinary
.code fork
and for creating the first process, though in
the latter case the process will start executing at
user-space location zero rather than at a return from
.code fork .
.PP
As we will see in Chapter \*[CH:TRAP],
the way that control transfers from user software to the kernel
is via an interrupt mechanism, which is used by system calls,
interrupts, and exceptions.
Whenever control transfers into the kernel while a process is running,
the hardware and xv6 trap entry code save user registers on the
process's kernel stack.
.code-index userinit
writes values at the top of the new stack that
look just like those that would be there if the
process had entered the kernel via an interrupt
.lines proc.c:/tf..cs.=./,/tf..eip.=./ ,
so that the ordinary code for returning from
the kernel back to the process's user code will work.
These values are a
.code-index "struct trapframe"
which stores the user registers.  Now the new process's kernel stack is
completely prepared as shown in 
.figref newkernelstack .
.PP
The first process is going to execute a small program
.code-index initcode.S ; (
.line initcode.S:1 ).
The process needs physical memory in which to store this
program, the program needs to be copied to that memory,
and the process needs a page table that maps user-space addresses to
that memory.
.PP
.code-index userinit
calls 
.code-index setupkvm
.line vm.c:/^setupkvm/
to create a page table for the process with (at first) mappings
only for memory that the kernel uses.
We will study  this function in detail in Chapter \*[CH:MEM], but
at a high level
.code setupkvm
and 
.code userinit 
create an address space
as shown in
.figref as .
.PP
The initial contents of the first process's user-space memory are
the compiled form of
.code-index initcode.S ;
as part of the kernel build process, the linker
embeds that binary in the kernel and
defines two special symbols,
.code-index _binary_initcode_start
and
.code-index _binary_initcode_size ,
indicating the location and size of the binary.
.code Userinit
copies that binary into the new process's memory
by calling
.code-index inituvm ,
which allocates one page of physical memory,
maps virtual address zero to that memory,
and copies the binary to that page
.line vm.c:/^inituvm/ .
.PP
Then 
.code userinit
sets up the trap frame
.line x86.h:/^struct.trapframe/
with the initial user mode state:
the
.register cs
register contains a segment selector for the
.code-index SEG_UCODE
segment running at privilege level
.code-index DPL_USER
(i.e., user mode rather than kernel mode),
and similarly
.register ds ,
.register es ,
and
.register ss
use
.code-index SEG_UDATA
with privilege
.code-index DPL_USER .
The
.register eflags
.code-index FL_IF
bit is set to allow hardware interrupts;
we will reexamine this in Chapter \*[CH:TRAP].
.PP
The stack pointer 
.register esp
is set to the process's largest valid virtual address,
.code p->sz .
The instruction pointer is set to the entry point
for the initcode, address 0.
.PP
The function
.code-index userinit
sets
.code-index p->name
to
.code "initcode"
mainly for debugging.
Setting
.code-index p->cwd
sets the process's current working directory;
we will examine
.code-index namei
in detail in Chapter \*[CH:FS].
.PP
Once the process is initialized,
.code-index userinit
marks it available for scheduling by setting 
.code p->state
to
.code-index RUNNABLE .
.\"
.section "Code: Running the first process"
.\"
Now that the first process's state is prepared,
it is time to run it.
After 
.code main
calls
.code userinit ,
.code-index mpmain
calls
.code-index scheduler
to start running processes
.line main.c:/scheduler/ .
.code Scheduler
.line proc.c:/^scheduler/
looks for a process with
.code p->state
set to
.code RUNNABLE ,
and there's only one:
.code initproc .
It sets the per-cpu variable
.code proc
to the process it found and calls
.code-index switchuvm
to tell the hardware to start using the target
process's page table
.line vm.c:/lcr3.*V2P.p..pgdir/ .
Changing page tables while executing in the kernel
works because 
.code-index setupkvm
causes all processes' page tables to have identical
mappings for kernel code and data.
.code switchuvm
also sets up a task state segment
.code-index SEG_TSS
that instructs the hardware to
execute system calls and interrupts
on the process's kernel stack.
We will re-examine the task state segment in Chapter \*[CH:TRAP].
.PP
.code-index scheduler
now sets
.code p->state
to
.code RUNNING
and calls
.code-index swtch
.line swtch.S:/^swtch/ 
to perform a context switch to the target process's kernel thread.
.code swtch 
first saves the current registers.
The current context is not a process but rather a special
per-cpu scheduler context, so
.code scheduler
tells
.code swtch
to save the current hardware registers in per-cpu storage
.code-index cpu->scheduler ) (
rather than in any process's kernel thread context.
.code swtch
then loads the saved registers
of the target kernel thread
.code p->context ) (
into the x86 hardware registers,
including the stack pointer and instruction pointer.
We'll examine
.code-index swtch
in more detail in Chapter \*[CH:SCHED].
The final
.code-index ret
instruction 
.line swtch.S:/ret$/
pops the target process's
.register eip
from the stack, finishing the context switch.
Now the processor is running on the kernel stack of process
.code p .
.PP
.code Allocproc
had previously set
.code initproc 's
.code p->context->eip
to
.code-index forkret ,
so the 
.code-index ret
starts executing
.code-index forkret .
On the first invocation (that is this one),
.code-index forkret
.line proc.c:/^forkret/
runs initialization functions that cannot be run from 
.code-index main 
because they must be run in the context of a regular process with its own
kernel stack. 
Then, 
.code forkret 
returns.
.code Allocproc
arranged that the top word on the stack after
.code-index p->context
is popped off
would be 
.code-index trapret ,
so now 
.code trapret
begins executing,
with 
.register esp
set to
.code p->tf .
.code Trapret
.line trapasm.S:/^trapret/ 
uses pop instructions to restore registers from
the trap frame
.line x86.h:/^struct.trapframe/
just as 
.code-index swtch
did with the kernel context:
.code-index popal
restores the general registers,
then the
.code-index popl 
instructions restore
.register gs ,
.register fs ,
.register es ,
and
.register ds .
The 
.code-index addl
skips over the two fields
.code trapno
and
.code errcode .
Finally, the
.code-index iret
instruction pops 
.register cs ,
.register eip ,
.register flags ,
.register esp ,
and
.register ss
from the stack.
The contents of the trap frame
have been transferred to the CPU state,
so the processor continues at the
.register eip
specified in the trap frame.
For
.code-index initproc ,
that means virtual address zero,
the first instruction of
.code-index initcode.S .
.PP
At this point,
.register eip
holds zero and
.register esp
holds 4096.
These are virtual addresses in the process's address space.
The processor's paging hardware translates them into physical addresses.
.code-index allocuvm
has set up the process's page table so that virtual address
zero refers
to the physical memory allocated for this process,
and set a flag
.code-index PTE_U ) (
that tells the paging hardware to allow user code to access that memory.
The fact that
.code-index userinit
.line proc.c:/UCODE/
set up the low bits of
.register cs
to run the process's user code at CPL=3 means that the user code
can only use pages with
.code PTE_U
set, and cannot modify sensitive hardware registers such as
.register cr3 .
So the process is constrained to using only its own memory.

.section "The first system call: exec"
.\"
.PP
Now that we have seen how the kernel provides strong isolation for processes, let's
look at how a user-level process re-enters the kernel to ask for services
that it cannot perform itself.
.PP
The first action of 
.code initcode.S
is to invoke  the
.code exec
system call.
As we saw in Chapter \*[CH:UNIX], 
.code-index exec
replaces the memory and registers of the
current process with a new program, but it leaves the
file descriptors, process id, and parent process unchanged.
.PP
.code Initcode.S
.line initcode.S:/^start/
begins by pushing three values
on the stack—\c
.code $argv ,
.code $init ,
and
.code $0 —\c
and then sets
.register eax
to
.code-index SYS_exec
and executes
.code int
.code-index T_SYSCALL :
it is asking the kernel to run the
.code-index exec
system call.
If all goes well,
.code exec
never returns: it starts running the program 
named by
.code $init ,
which is a pointer to
the NUL-terminated string
.code "/init"
.line initcode.S:/init.0/,/init.0/ .
The other argument is the
.code argv
array of command-line arguments; the zero at the
end of the array marks its end.
If the
.code exec
fails and does return,
initcode
loops calling the
.code-index exit
system call, which definitely
should not return
.line initcode.S:/for.*exit/,/jmp.exit/ .
.PP
This code manually crafts the first system call to look like
an ordinary system call, which we will see in Chapter \*[CH:TRAP].  As
before, this setup avoids special-casing the first process (in this
case, its first system call), and instead reuses code that xv6 must
provide for standard operation.
.PP 
Chapter \*[CH:MEM] will cover the implementation of
.code exec 
in detail, but at a high level it
replaces
.code initcode 
with the 
.code-index /init
binary, loaded out of the file system.
Now 
.code-index initcode
.line initcode.S:1
is done, and the process will run
.code-index /init
instead.
.code Init
.line init.c:/^main/
creates a new console device file
if needed
and then opens it as file descriptors 0, 1, and 2.
Then it loops,
starting a console shell, 
handles orphaned zombies until the shell exits,
and repeats.
The system is up.

.section "Real world"
.\"
.PP
In the real world, one can find both monolithic kernels and microkernels. Many
Unix kernels are monolithic. For example, Linux has a monolithic kernel,
although some OS functions run as user-level servers (e.g., the windowing
system).  Kernels such as L4, Minix, QNX are organized as a microkernel with
servers, and have seen wide deployment in embedded settings.
.PP
Most operating systems have adopted the process
concept, and most processes look similar to xv6's.
A real operating system would find free
.code proc
structures with an explicit free list
in constant time instead of the linear-time search in
.code allocproc ;
xv6 uses the linear scan
(the first of many) for simplicity.
.PP

.section "Exercises"
.\"
1. Set a breakpoint at swtch.  Single step with gdb's
.code stepi
through the ret to
.code forkret ,
then use gdb's
.code finish
to proceed to
.code trapret ,
then
.code stepi
until you get to
.code initcode 
at virtual address zero.

2.
.code KERNBASE 
limits the amount of memory a single process can use,
which might be irritating on a machine with a full 4 GB of RAM.
Would raising
.code KERNBASE
allow a process to use more memory?
