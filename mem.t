.chapter CH:MEM "Page tables"
.PP
Page tables are the mechanism through which the operating system controls what
memory addresses mean.  They allow xv6 to multiplex the address spaces of
different processes onto a single physical memory, and to protect the memories
of different processes.  The level of indirection provided by page tables allows
many neat tricks.  xv6 uses page
tables primarily to
multiplex address spaces and to protect memory.  It also uses a few
simple page-table tricks: mapping the same memory (the kernel) in several address spaces,
mapping the same memory more than once in one address space
(each user page is also mapped into the kernel's physical view of memory),
and guarding a user stack with
an unmapped page.  The rest of this chapter explains the page tables that the x86
hardware provides and how xv6 uses them.  Compared to a real-world operating
system, xv6's design is restrictive, but it does illustrate the key ideas.
.\"
.section "Paging hardware"
.\"
As a reminder,
x86 instructions (both user and kernel) manipulate virtual addresses.
The machine's RAM, or physical memory, is indexed with physical
addresses.
The x86 page table hardware connects these two kinds of addresses,
by mapping each virtual address to a physical address.
.PP
An x86 page table is logically an array of 2^20
(1,048,576)
.italic-index "page table entries (PTEs)".
Each PTE contains a
20-bit physical page number (PPN) and some flags. The paging
hardware translates a virtual address by using its top 20 bits
to index into the page table to find a PTE, and replacing
the address's top 20 bits with the PPN in the PTE.  The paging hardware
copies the low 12 bits unchanged from the virtual to the
translated physical address.  Thus a page table gives
the operating system control over virtual-to-physical address translations
at the granularity of aligned chunks of 4096 (2^12) bytes.
Such a chunk is called a
.italic-index page .
.figure x86_pagetable
.PP
As shown in
.figref x86_pagetable ,
the actual translation happens in two steps.
A page table is stored in physical memory as a two-level tree.
The root of the tree is a 4096-byte
.italic-index "page directory"
that contains 1024 PTE-like references to
.italic-index "page table pages".
Each page table page is an array of 1024 32-bit PTEs.
The paging hardware uses the top 10 bits of a virtual address to
select a page directory entry.
If the page directory entry is present,
the paging hardware uses the next 10 bits of the virtual
address to select a PTE from the page table page that the
page directory entry refers to.
If either the page directory entry or the PTE is not present,
the paging hardware raises a fault.
This two-level structure allows a page table to omit entire
page table pages in the common case in which large ranges of
virtual addresses have no mappings.
.PP
Each PTE contains flag bits that tell the paging hardware
how the associated virtual address is allowed to be used.
.code-index PTE_P
indicates whether the PTE is present: if it is
not set, a reference to the page causes a fault (i.e. is not allowed).
.code-index PTE_W
controls whether instructions are allowed to issue
writes to the page; if not set, only reads and
instruction fetches are allowed.
.code-index PTE_U
controls whether user programs are allowed to use the
page; if clear, only the kernel is allowed to use the page.
.figref x86_pagetable
shows how it all works.
The flags and all other page hardware related structures are defined in
.file "mmu.h"
.sheet mmu.h .
.PP
A few notes about terms.
Physical memory refers to storage cells in DRAM.
A byte of physical memory has an address, called a physical address.
Instructions use only virtual addresses, which the
paging hardware translates to physical addresses, and then
sends to the DRAM hardware to read or write storage.
At this level of discussion there is no such thing as virtual memory,
only virtual addresses.
.figure xv6_layout
.\"
.section "Process address space"
.\"
.PP
The page table created by
.code entry
has enough mappings to allow the kernel's C code to start running.
However,
.code main
immediately changes to a new page table by calling
.code-index kvmalloc
.line vm.c:/^kvmalloc/ ,
because kernel has a more elaborate plan for describing
process address spaces.
.PP
Each process has a separate page table, and xv6 tells
the page table hardware to switch
page tables when xv6 switches between processes.
As shown in
.figref xv6_layout ,
a process's user memory starts at virtual address
zero and can grow up to
.address KERNBASE ,
allowing a process to address up to 2 gigabytes of memory.
The file
.file "memlayout.h"
.sheet memlayout.h
declares the constants for xv6's memory layout,
and macros to convert virtual to physical addresses.
.PP
When a process asks xv6 for more memory,
xv6 first finds free physical pages to provide the storage,
and then adds PTEs to the process's page table that point
to the new physical pages.
xv6 sets the
.code PTE_U ,
.code PTE_W ,
and
.code PTE_P
flags in these PTEs.
Most processes do not use the entire user address space;
xv6 leaves
.code PTE_P
clear in unused PTEs.
Different processes' page tables translate user addresses
to different pages of physical memory, so that each process has
private user memory.
.PP
Xv6 includes all mappings needed for the kernel to run in every
process's page table; these mappings all appear above
.address KERNBASE .
It maps virtual addresses
.address KERNBASE:KERNBASE+PHYSTOP
to
.address 0:PHYSTOP .
One reason for this mapping is so that the kernel can use its
own instructions and data.
Another reason is that the kernel sometimes needs to be able
to write a given page of physical memory, for example
when creating page table pages; having every physical
page appear at a predictable virtual address makes this convenient.
A defect of this arrangement is that xv6 cannot make use of
more than 2 gigabytes of physical memory, because the kernel
part of the address space is 2 gigabytes.
Thus, xv6 requires that
.address PHYSTOP
be smaller than 2 gigabytes, even if the computer
has more than 2 gigabytes of physical memory.
.PP
Some devices that use memory-mapped I/O appear at physical
addresses starting at
.address 0xFE000000 ,
so xv6 page tables including a direct mapping for them.
Thus,
.address PHYSTOP
must be smaller than two gigabytes - 16 megabytes (for the device memory).
.PP
Xv6 does not set the
.code-index PTE_U
flag in the PTEs above
.address KERNBASE ,
so only the kernel can use them.
.PP
Having every process's page table contain mappings for
both user memory and the entire kernel is convenient
when switching from user code to kernel code during
system calls and interrupts: such switches do not
require page table switches.
For the most part the kernel does not have its own page
table; it is almost always borrowing some process's page table.
.PP
To review, xv6 ensures that each process can use only its own memory.  And, each
process sees its memory as having contiguous virtual addresses starting at zero,
while the process's physical memory can be non-contiguous.  xv6 implements the
first by setting the
.code-index PTE_U
bit only on PTEs of virtual addresses that refer to the process's own memory.  It
implements the second using the ability of page tables to translate successive
virtual addresses to whatever physical pages happen to be allocated to the
process.
.\"
.section "Code: creating an address space"
.\"
.PP
.code-index main
calls
.code-index kvmalloc
.line vm.c:/^kvmalloc/
to create and switch to a page table with the mappings above
.code KERNBASE
required for the kernel to run.
Most of the work happens in
.code-index setupkvm
.line vm.c:/^setupkvm/ .
It first allocates a page of memory to hold the page directory.
Then it calls
.code-index mappages
to install the translations that the kernel needs,
which are described in the
.code-index kmap
.line vm.c:/^}.kmap/
array.
The translations include the kernel's
instructions and data, physical memory up to
.code-index PHYSTOP ,
and memory ranges which are actually I/O devices.
.code setupkvm
does not install any mappings for the user memory;
this will happen later.
.PP
.code-index mappages
.line vm.c:/^mappages/
installs mappings into a page table
for a range of virtual addresses to
a corresponding range of physical addresses.
It does this separately for each virtual address in the range,
at page intervals.
For each virtual address to be mapped,
.code mappages
calls
.code-index walkpgdir
to find the address of the PTE for that address.
It then initializes the PTE to hold the relevant physical page
number, the desired permissions (
.code PTE_W
and/or
.code PTE_U ),
and
.code PTE_P
to mark the PTE as valid
.line vm.c:/perm...PTE_P/ .
.PP
.code-index walkpgdir
.line vm.c:/^walkpgdir/
mimics the actions of the x86 paging hardware as it
looks up the PTE for a virtual address (see
.figref x86_pagetable ).
.code walkpgdir
uses the upper 10 bits of the virtual address to find
the page directory entry
.line vm.c:/pde.=..pgdir/ .
If the page directory entry isn't present, then
the required page table page hasn't yet been allocated;
if the
.code alloc
argument is set,
.code walkpgdir
allocates it and puts its physical address in the page directory.
Finally it uses the next 10 bits of the virtual address
to find the address of the PTE in the page table page
.line vm.c:/return..pgtab/ .
.\"
.section "Physical memory allocation"
.\"
.PP
The kernel must allocate and free physical memory at run-time for
page tables,
process user memory,
kernel stacks,
and pipe buffers.
.PP
xv6 uses the physical memory between the end of the kernel and
.code-index PHYSTOP
for run-time allocation. It allocates and frees whole 4096-byte pages
at a time. It keeps track of which pages are free by threading a
linked list through the pages themselves. Allocation consists of
removing a page from the linked list; freeing consists of adding the
freed page to the list.
.PP
There is a bootstrap problem: all of physical memory must be mapped in
order for the allocator to initialize the free list, but creating a
page table with those mappings involves allocating page-table pages.
xv6 solves this problem by using a separate page allocator during
entry, which allocates memory just after the end of the kernel's data
segment. This allocator does not support freeing and is limited by the
4 MB mapping in the
.code entrypgdir ,
but that is sufficient to allocate the first kernel page table.
.\"
.section "Code: Physical memory allocator"
.\"
.PP
The allocator's data structure is a
.italic "free list"
of physical memory pages that are available
for allocation.
Each free page's list element is a
.code-index "struct run"
.line kalloc.c:/^struct.run/ .
Where does the allocator get the memory
to hold that data structure?
It store each free page's
.code run
structure in the free page itself,
since there's nothing else stored there.
The free list is
protected by a spin lock
.line 'kalloc.c:/^struct.{/,/}/' .
The list and the lock are wrapped in a struct
to make clear that the lock protects the fields
in the struct.
For now, ignore the lock and the calls to
.code acquire
and
.code release ;
Chapter \*[CH:LOCK] will examine
locking in detail.
.PP
The function
.code-index main
calls
.code-index kinit1
and
.code-index kinit2
to initialize the allocator
.line kalloc.c:/^kinit1/ .
The reason for having two calls is that for much of
.code main
one cannot use locks or
memory above 4 megabytes. The call to
.code kinit1
sets up for lock-less allocation in the first 4 megabytes,
and the call to
.code kinit2
enables locking and arranges for more memory to be allocatable.
.code main
ought to determine how much physical
memory is available, but this
turns out to be difficult on the x86.
Instead it assumes that the machine has
224 megabytes
.code PHYSTOP ) (
of physical memory, and uses all the memory between the end of the kernel
and
.code-index PHYSTOP
as the initial pool of free memory.
.code kinit1
and
.code kinit2
call
.code-index freerange
to add memory to the free list via per-page calls to
.code-index kfree .
A PTE can only refer to a physical address that is aligned
on a 4096-byte boundary (is a multiple of 4096), so
.code freerange
uses
.code-index PGROUNDUP
to ensure that it frees only aligned physical addresses.
The allocator starts with no memory;
these calls to
.code kfree
give it some to manage.
.PP
The allocator refers to physical pages by their virtual
addresses as mapped in high memory, not by their physical
addresses, which is why
.code kinit
uses
.code P2V(PHYSTOP)
to translate
.code PHYSTOP
(a physical address)
to a virtual address.
The allocator sometimes treats addresses as integers
in order to perform arithmetic on them (e.g.,
traversing all pages in
.code kinit ),
and sometimes uses addresses as pointers to read and
write memory (e.g., manipulating the
.code run
structure stored in each page);
this dual use of addresses is the main reason that the
allocator code is full of C type casts.
.index "type cast"
The other reason is that freeing and allocation inherently
change the type of the memory.
.PP
The function
.code kfree
.line kalloc.c:/^kfree/
begins by setting every byte in the
memory being freed to the value 1.
This will cause code that uses memory after freeing it
(uses ``dangling references'')
to read garbage instead of the old valid contents;
hopefully that will cause such code to break faster.
Then
.code kfree
casts
.code v
to a pointer to
.code struct
.code run ,
records the old start of the free list in
.code r->next ,
and sets the free list equal to
.code r .
.code-index kalloc
removes and returns the first element in the free list.
.\"
.section "User part of an address space"
.\"
.figure processlayout
.PP
.figref processlayout
shows the layout of the user memory of an executing process in xv6.
Each user process starts at address 0. The bottom of the address space
contains the text for the user program, its data, and its stack.
The heap is above the stack so that the heap can expand when the process
calls
.code-index sbrk .
Note that the text, data, and stack sections are layed out contiguously in the
process's address space but xv6 is free to use non-contiguous physical pages for
those sections. For example, when xv6 expands a process's heap, it can use any
free physical page for the new virtual page and then program the page table
hardware to map the virtual page to the allocated physical page.  This
flexibility is a major advantage of using paging hardware.
.PP
The stack is a single page, and is
shown with the initial contents as created by exec.
Strings containing the command-line arguments, as well as an
array of pointers to them, are at the very top of the stack.
Just under that are values that allow a program
to start at
.code main
as if the function call
.code main(argc,
.code argv)
had just started.
To guard a stack growing off the stack page, xv6 places a guard page right below
the stack.  The guard page is not mapped and so if the stack runs off the stack
page, the hardware will generate an exception because it cannot translate the
faulting address.
A real-world operating system might allocate more space for the stack so that it can
grow beyond one page.
.\"
.section "Code: sbrk"
.\"
.code Sbrk
is the system call for a process to shrink or grow its memory. The system
call is implemented by the function
.code growproc
.line proc.c:/^growproc/ .
If
.code n
is postive,
.code growproc
allocates one or more physical pages and maps them at the top of the process's
address space.  If
.code n
is negative,
.code growproc
unmaps one or more pages from the process's address space and frees the corresponding
physical pages.
To make these changes,
.code
xv6 modifies the process's page table.  The process's page table is stored in
memory, and so the kernel can update the table with ordinary assignment
statements, which is what
.code allocuvm
and
.code deallocuvm
do.
The x86 hardware caches page table entries in a
.italic-index "Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)" ,
and when xv6 changes the page tables, it must invalidate the cached entries.  If
it didn't invalidate the cached entries, then at some point later the TLB might
use an old mapping, pointing to a physical page that in the mean time has been
allocated to another process, and as a result, a process might be able to
scribble on some other process's memory. Xv6 invalidates stale cached entries,
by reloading
.code cr3 ,
the register that holds the address of the current page table.
.\"
.section "Code: exec"
.\"
.code Exec
is the system call that creates the user part of an address space.  It
initializes the user part of an address space from a file stored in the file
system.
.code Exec
.line exec.c:/^exec/
opens the named binary
.code path
using
.code-index namei
.line exec.c:/namei/ ,
which is explained in Chapter \*[CH:FS].
Then, it reads the ELF header. Xv6 applications are described in the widely-used
.italic-index "ELF format" ,
defined in
.file elf.h .
An ELF binary consists of an ELF header,
.code-index "struct elfhdr"
.line elf.h:/^struct.elfhdr/ ,
followed by a sequence of program section headers,
.code "struct proghdr"
.line elf.h:/^struct.proghdr/ .
Each
.code proghdr
describes a section of the application that must be loaded into memory;
xv6 programs have only one program section header, but
other systems might have separate sections
for instructions and data.
.PP
The first step is a quick check that the file probably contains an
ELF binary.
An ELF binary starts with the four-byte ``magic number''
.code 0x7F ,
.code 'E' ,
.code 'L' ,
.code 'F' ,
or
.code-index ELF_MAGIC
.line elf.h:/ELF_MAGIC/ .
If the ELF header has the right magic number,
.code exec
assumes that the binary is well-formed.
.PP
.code Exec
allocates a new page table with no user mappings with
.code-index setupkvm
.line exec.c:/setupkvm/ ,
allocates memory for each ELF segment with
.code-index allocuvm
.line exec.c:/allocuvm/ ,
and loads each segment into memory with
.code-index loaduvm
.line exec.c:/loaduvm/ .
.code allocuvm
checks that the virtual addresses requested
is below
.address KERNBASE .
.code-index loaduvm
.line vm.c:/^loaduvm/
uses
.code-index walkpgdir
to find the physical address of the allocated memory at which to write
each page of the ELF segment, and
.code-index readi
to read from the file.
.PP
The program section header for
.code-index /init ,
the first user program created with
.code exec ,
looks like this:
.P1
# objdump -p _init

_init:     file format elf32-i386

Program Header:
    LOAD off    0x00000054 vaddr 0x00000000 paddr 0x00000000 align 2**2
         filesz 0x000008c0 memsz 0x000008cc flags rwx
.P2
.PP
The program section header's
.code filesz
may be less than the
.code memsz ,
indicating that the gap between them should be filled
with zeroes (for C global variables) rather than read from the file.
For
.code /init ,
.code filesz
is 2240 bytes and
.code memsz
is 2252 bytes,
and thus
.code-index allocuvm
allocates enough physical memory to hold 2252 bytes, but reads only 2240 bytes
from the file
.code /init .
.PP
Now
.code-index exec
allocates and initializes the user stack.
It allocates just one stack page.
.code Exec
copies the argument strings to the top of the stack
one at a time, recording the pointers to them in
.code-index ustack .
It places a null pointer at the end of what will be the
.code-index argv
list passed to
.code main .
The first three entries in
.code ustack
are the fake return PC,
.code-index argc ,
and
.code argv
pointer.
.PP
.code Exec
places an inaccessible page just below the stack page,
so that programs that try to use more than one page will fault.
This inaccessible page also allows
.code exec
to deal with arguments that are too large;
in that situation,
the
.code-index copyout
.line vm.c:/^copyout/
function that
.code exec
uses to copy arguments to the stack will notice that
the destination page is not accessible, and will
return \-1.
.PP
During the preparation of the new memory image,
if
.code exec
detects an error like an invalid program segment,
it jumps to the label
.code bad ,
frees the new image,
and returns \-1.
.code Exec
must wait to free the old image until it
is sure that the system call will succeed:
if the old image is gone,
the system call cannot return \-1 to it.
The only error cases in
.code exec
happen during the creation of the image.
Once the image is complete,
.code exec
can install the new image
.line exec.c:/switchuvm/
and free the old one
.line exec.c:/freevm/ .
Finally,
.code exec
returns 0.
.PP
.code Exec
loads bytes from the ELF file into memory at addresses specified by the ELF file.
Users or processes can place whatever addresses they want into an ELF file.
Thus
.code exec
is risky, because the addresses in the ELF file may refer to the kernel, accidentally
or on purpose. The consequences for an unwary kernel could range from
a crash to a malicious subversion of the kernel's isolation mechanisms
(i.e., a security exploit).
xv6 performs a number of checks to avoid these risks.
To understand the importance of these checks, consider what could happen
if xv6 didn't check
.code "if(ph.vaddr + ph.memsz < ph.vaddr)" .
This is a check for whether the sum overflows a 32-bit integer.
The danger is that a user could construct an ELF binary with a
.code ph.vaddr
that points into the kernel,
and
.code ph.memsz
large enough that the sum overflows to 0x1000.
Since the sum is small, it would pass the check
.code "if(newsz >= KERNBASE)"
in
. code allocuvm .
The subsequent call to 
.code loaduvm
passes
.code ph.vaddr
by itself, without adding
.code ph.memsz 
and without checking
.code ph.vaddr
against
.code KERNBASE ,
and would thus copy data from the ELF binary into the kernel.
This could be exploited by a user
program to run arbitrary user code with kernel privileges.  As this example
illustrates, argument checking must be done with great care.
It is easy for a kernel developer to omit a crucial check, and
real-world kernels have a long history of missing checks whose absence
can be exploited by user programs to obtain kernel privileges.  It is likely that xv6 doesn't do a complete job of validating
user-level data supplied to the kernel, which a malicious user program might be able to exploit to circumvent xv6's isolation.

This program generates an ELF and have the system load it via exec system call.
In loading this ELF, one of ph.vaddr + ph.memsz becomes 0x1000 due to integer wrapping.
ph.vaddr is pointing at the kernel data, and loaduvm() will overwrite there.
devsw[0].read will be overwritten by the address of shellcode() via this loading, and after that,
when this process use read system call for special file with major = 0,
the function shellcode(), which is created by a user, will be executed according to the overwritten devsw.

Like most operating systems, xv6 uses the paging hardware
for memory protection and mapping. Most operating systems use x86's 64-bit paging
hardware (which has 3 levels of translation). 64-bit address spaces allow for a
less restrictive memory layout than xv6's; for example, it would be easy to
remove xv6's limit of 2 gigabytes for physical memory.
Most operating systems make far more sophisticated
use of paging than xv6; for example, xv6 lacks demand
paging from disk, copy-on-write fork, shared memory,
lazily-allocated pages,
and automatically extending stacks.
The x86 supports address translation using segmentation (see Appendix \*[APP:BOOT]),
but xv6 uses segments only for the common trick of
implementing per-cpu variables such as
.code proc
that are at a fixed address but have different values
on different CPUs (see
.code-index seginit ).
Implementations of per-CPU (or per-thread) storage on non-segment
architectures would dedicate a register to holding a pointer
to the per-CPU data area, but the x86 has so few general
registers that the extra effort required to use segmentation
is worthwhile.
.PP
Xv6 maps the kernel in the address space of each user process but sets it up so
that the kernel part of the address space is inaccessible when the processor is
in user mode.  This setup is convenient because after a process switches from
user space to kernel space, the kernel can easily access user memory by reading
memory locations directly.  It is probably better for security, however, to have
a separate page table for the kernel and switch to that page table when entering
the kernel from user mode, so that the kernel and user processes are more
separated from each other.  This design, for example, would help mitigating
side-channels that are exposed by the Meltdown vulnerability and that allow a
user process to read arbitrary kernel memory.
.PP
On machines with lots of memory
it might make sense to use
the x86's 4-megabytes ``super pages.''
Small pages make sense
when physical memory is small, to allow allocation and page-out to disk
with fine granularity.
For example, if a program
uses only 8 kilobytes of memory, giving it a 4 megabytes physical page is wasteful.
Larger pages make sense on machines with lots of RAM,
and may reduce overhead for page-table manipulation.
Xv6 uses super pages in one place:
the initial page table
.line 'main.c:/^pde_t.entrypgdir.*=/' .
The array initialization sets two of the 1024 PDEs,
at indices zero and 512
.code KERNBASE>>PDXSHIFT ), (
leaving the other PDEs zero.
Xv6 sets the
.code PTE_PS
bit in these two PDEs to mark them as super pages.
The kernel also tells the paging hardware to allow super pages by setting the
.code-index CR_PSE
bit
(Page Size Extension) in
.register cr4 .
.PP
Xv6 should determine the actual RAM configuration, instead
of assuming 224 MB.
On the x86, there are at least three common algorithms:
the first is to probe the physical address space looking for
regions that behave like memory, preserving the values
written to them;
the second is to read the number of kilobytes of
memory out of a known 16-bit location in the PC's non-volatile RAM;
and the third is to look in BIOS memory
for a memory layout table left as
part of the multiprocessor tables.
Reading the memory layout table
is complicated.
.PP
Memory allocation was a hot topic a long time ago, the basic problems being
efficient use of limited memory and
preparing for unknown future requests;
see Knuth.  Today people care more about speed than
space-efficiency.  In addition, a more elaborate kernel
would likely allocate many different sizes of small blocks,
rather than (as in xv6) just 4096-byte blocks;
a real kernel
allocator would need to handle small allocations as well as large
ones.

.section "Exercises"
.\"
.PP
1. Look at real operating systems to see how they size memory.
.PP
2. If xv6 had not used super pages, what would be the right declaration for
.code entrypgdir?
.PP
3. Write a user program that grows its address space with 1 byte by calling
.code sbrk(1) .
Run the  program and investigate the page table for the program before the call
to
.code sbrk
and after the call to
.code sbrk .
How much space has the kernel allocated?  What does the
.code pte
for the new memory contain?
.PP
4. Modify xv6 so that the pages for the kernel are shared among processes, which
reduces memory consumption.
.PP
5. Modify xv6 so that when a user program dereferences a null pointer, it will
receive a fault.  That is, modify xv6 so that virtual address 0 isn't mapped for
user programs.
.PP
6. Unix implementations of
.code exec
traditionally include special handling for shell scripts.
If the file to execute begins with the text
.code #! ,
then the first line is taken to be a program
to run to interpret the file.
For example, if
.code exec
is called to run
.code myprog
.code arg1
and
.code myprog 's
first line is
.code #!/interp ,
then
.code exec
runs
.code /interp
with command line
.code /interp
.code myprog
.code arg1 .
Implement support for this convention in xv6.
.PP
7. Delete the check
.code "if(ph.vaddr + ph.memsz < ph.vaddr)"
in
.code exec.c ,
and construct a user  program that exploits that the check is missing.
.PP
8. Change xv6 so that user processes run with only a minimal part of the kernel
mapped and so that the kernel runs with its own page table that doesn't include
the user process.
.PP
9. How would you improve xv6's memory layout if xv6 where running on a 64-bit
processor?
